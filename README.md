# Email-SMS-Spam-Classifier
Steps--

*Data Collection:
Gather a labeled dataset containing SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.
Ensure a diverse and representative dataset for better model performance.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the text data:
Remove special characters, numbers, and punctuation.
Convert text to lowercase.
Tokenization: split the text into individual words (tokens).
Remove stop words (common words that do not contribute much to the meaning).
Stemming or lemmatization: reduce words to their root form.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand the distribution of spam and ham messages in the dataset.
Explore common words in spam and ham messages.

Feature Extraction:
Convert the processed text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms.
Techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).

Model Selection:
Choose a suitable machine learning model for text classification. Common choices include:
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM, GRU)

Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the chosen model using the training set.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.

Evaluate the model on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Use a confusion matrix to understand the model's performance in more detail.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Adjust hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.
Consider techniques like grid search or random search for optimization

Model Deployment:
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for use in a production environment.
Implement any necessary APIs or interfaces for integration with other systems.

Monitoring and Maintenance:
Regularly monitor the model's performance in a real-world setting.
Update the model as needed to adapt to changes in the data distribution.

User Interface (Optional):
Develop a user interface if the model is intended for use by non-technical users.
Provide a way for users to interact with the model and input new SMS messages for classification.
Remember to iterate on these steps based on the performance of the model and any new data that becomes available. The choice of algorithms and techniques may vary based on the specifics of your project and available resources.
